# Level 5 â†’ Level 6

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the **inhere** directory and has all of the following properties:

* human-readable
* 1033 bytes in size
* not executable

### Commands you may need to solve this level

[ls](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) , [cd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html) , [cat](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) , [file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html) , [du](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/du.1.html) , [find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)

### Solution:

* To find the file with specific size in current directory

```bash
$ find . -size <S>1000<X>
    
S = + (greater than) 
    - (smaller than)

X = c - byte
		k - kilo
    M - mega
    G - giga

```
