* It accepts two sets of characters, usually with the same length, and replaces the characters of the first sets with the corresponding characters from the second set.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
$ tr SET1 [SET2]
SET = string of characters, including the special backslash-escaped characters.
```
{% endcode %}
